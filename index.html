						<h3 class="year">1986</h3>
						<p>Out of the void and into Connecticut, of all places.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="milestone">
						<h3 class="year">1992</h3>
						<p>Rocking an IBM Tandy with Direct Access, I went through countless toner ribbons on the family dot matrix printer making things in Paint Shop Pro. Also became adept at discerning the global whereabouts of one Carmen Sandiego.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="milestone">
						<h3 class="year">1997</h3>
						<p>Unleashed onto AOL.  A second phone line was acquired.  Neopets.  Angelfire.  Geocities.  Web rings. I built anything that didn&apos;t require a credit card. Funky Chickens HTML help forever in our hearts.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="milestone">
						<h3 class="year">2002</h3>
						<p>Babys first pirated copy of Photoshop 6, sent via snail mail on a burned CD because it was quicker than downloading it. Purchased my first domain name and hosting plan after thoroughly confusing my dad as to what I needed to use his credit card for. Figured out how to use a blogging platform called Greymatter.  Have never needed Perl or CGI since.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="milestone">
						<h3 class="year">2004</h3>
						<p>Graduated High School. Shacked up with WordPress. Relocated to Providence, Rhode Island to attend Johnson & Wales University for Computer Graphics and New Media. Learned Flash just in time for it to become obsolete.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="milestone">
						<h3 class="year">2008</h3>
						<p>Graduated Johnson & Wales with my BS. Started at my first web agency as a front end developer and designer. The rest is work history.</p>
